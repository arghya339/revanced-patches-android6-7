## How to patch
See [[How to build]](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/wiki/How-to-build) page in documentations.

## About
The last YouTube app available on Android 6 or 7 is **17.34.36**.

And ReVanced Extended **v2.160.1** was the last patch compatible with 17.34.36.

So I decided to fork RVX v2.160.1 to support YouTube 17.34.36.  
I fixed some issues for 17.34.36 and backported some features (**including endless buffering fix**) from newer patch.

Also, I released a fork ReVanced Manager for Android 5-7.

## Issue
For suggestions and bug reports, open an issue.

## Todo
~~I would like to quit developing based on 2.160.1 and remake it based on the latest RVX. (for well maintainabilityüîß, updated translationüåç and new features‚ú®)~~ it's difficult for me

## I have skill issue...
Embarrassingly, I'm not very familiar with reverse engineering and also programming. (But I can read a little smali :D )  
So I can not create new patches by myself. All my modifying are merely copy and paste.

If anyone else is interested in developing a ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 besides me, please don't hesitate to release it!  
If a more excellent ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 is emerged, I will immediately stop releasing my one and introduce yours!

Also all contributions are welcomed!
